\textbf{Carnegie Mellon University -- School of Computer Science} \hfill \textit{Pittsburgh, PA (Remote)} \\
{\small Teaching Assistant for 17323/17623: Quality Assurance} \hfill \textit{\small October 2020 - Present}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Conducted office hours for students to help them with the coursework/projects, and evaluated the project submissions.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{GoDaddy Inc.} \hfill \textit{Kirkland, WA (Remote)} \\
{\small Intern --- Software Development Engineer} \hfill \textit{\small May 2020 - August 2020}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Reduced execution time of the analytics tool by two hours by redesigning it into multiple processes.
  \item Devised an AWS Batch based architecture to parallelize analysis in the analytics tool, which will further decrease runtime.
  \item Volunteered for the scrum master role to handle our project backlog on Jira, scrum meetings, and retrospective.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Zoho Corporation} \hfill \textit{Chennai, India} \\
{\small Member Technical Staff} \hfill \textit{\small June 2018 - May 2019}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Simplified transaction handling by implementing an annotation-based framework using Aspect-Oriented Programming.
  \item Designed an HTTP connection pool library that can share pools between modules separate in multiple codebases.
  \item Modularized i18n keysets by developing a library to load and validate keys across multiple repositories without collision.
  \item Distributed configuration across runtime-dependent repositories by building a tool to manage and validate conf files.
  \item Fixed distributed lock handling mechanism in Zoho CRM, which removed race-conditions between database operations.
\end{itemize}
{\small Project Trainee} \hfill \textit{\small December 2017 - March 2018}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Minimized dependency among teams by decoupling Zoho CRM into several compile-time independent components.
  \item Architected an observable-based inter-service communication framework that can resolve function calls at runtime.
\end{itemize}

{\small Project Intern} \hfill \textit{\small June 2017 - July 2017}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Prototyped a chatbot to simplify data lookup in Planatics, a financial data management tool, using RASA NLU and flask.
  \item Separated the chatbot service from the tool using microservice design-pattern and REST API for service interaction.
\end{itemize}
\section*{CMU Projects}

\\
\textbf{Distributed Bitcoin Miner} \hfill \textit{Fall 2020}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Modeled an application layer protocol on top of UDP with resilience, liveness, and packet sequencing.
  \item Designed the protocol to be connection-oriented and supported client-server model natively.
  \item Implemented a distributed bitcoin miner system on top of this protocol with fault-tolerance.
  \item Designed the miner to be the client and the server to load-balance mining jobs using SRTF scheduling and chunking.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Scalable Ecommerce Web Application} \hfill \textit{Spring 2020}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Engineered a highly-scalable e-commerce app that can serve over a million requests/minute using EC2 and load balancer.
  \item Handled search functionality for around a million products using AWS RDS for storage and AWS ElastiCache for caching.
  \item Improved response time to under a second by devising a distributed in-memory caching framework.
  \item Synchronized the distributed cache using check-on-use invalidation strategy and handle overflow using LRU eviction.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Smart Home System} \hfill \textit{Spring 2020}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Built a java-based smart home web platform that can handle around 500 concurrent TCP connections.
  \item Assembled a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Kubernetes that allowed single command update/rollback.
  \item Performed static/dynamic analysis in the pipeline using JUnit, JaCoCo, Checker Framework, PITest to monitor quality.
  \item Orchestrated an A/B testing component to split users between two ML models and analyze the success rate in real-time.
\end{itemize}
