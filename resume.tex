\textbf{GoDaddy Inc.} \hfill \textit{Kirkland, WA (Remote)} \\
{\small Intern --- Software Development Engineer} \hfill \textit{\small May 2020 - Present}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Reduced execution time of our analytics tool by two hours by redesigning it into multiple processes.
  \item Devised an AWS Batch based architecture to parallelize analysis in our tool, which might further decrease runtime.
  \item Volunteered for the scrum master role to handle our project backlog on Jira, meetings, and retrospective.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Zoho Corporation} \hfill \textit{Chennai, India} \\
{\small Member Technical Staff} \hfill \textit{\small June 2018 - May 2019}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Simplified transaction handling by implementing an annotation-based framework using Aspect-Oriented Programming.
  \item Designed an HTTP connection pool library that can share pools between modules separate in multiple codebases.
  \item Modularized i18n keysets by developing a library to load and validate keys across multiple repositories without collision.
  \item Distributed configuration across runtime-dependent repositories by building a tool to manage and validate conf files.
  \item Fixed distributed lock handling mechanism in Zoho CRM, which removed race-conditions between database operations.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Zoho Corporation} \hfill \textit{Chennai, India} \\
{\small Project Trainee} \hfill \textit{\small December 2017 - March 2018}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Minimized dependency among teams by decoupling Zoho CRM into several compile-time independent components.
  \item Architected an observable-based inter-service communication framework that can resolve function calls at runtime.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Tata Consultancy Services} \hfill \textit{Chennai, India} \\
{\small Project Intern} \hfill \textit{\small June 2017 - July 2017}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Prototyped a chatbot to simplify data lookup in Planatics, a financial data management tool, using RASA NLU and flask.
  \item Separated the chatbot service from the tool using microservice design-pattern and REST API for service interaction.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Projects}
\titlerule
\noindent
\\
\textbf{Scalable Ecommerce Web Application} \hfill \textit{Carnegie Mellon University}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Engineered a highly-scalable e-commerce app that can serve over a million requests/minute using EC2 and load balancer.
  \item Loaded around a million products into the system using AWS RDS for storage.
  \item Improved search response time to under a second by devising a distributed caching framework on AWS ElastiCache.
  \item Handled simultaneous requests from the same user by distributed session tracking on Redis.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Smart Home System} \hfill \textit{Carnegie Mellon University}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Built a java-based smart home web platform that can handle around 500 concurrent TCP connections.
  \item Assembled a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Kubernetes that allowed single command update/rollback.
  \item Performed static/dynamic analysis in the pipeline using JUnit, JaCoCo, Checker Framework, PITest to monitor quality.
  \item Orchestrated an A/B testing component to split users between two ML models and analyze the success rate in real-time.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Yabber} \hfill \textit{Personal Project}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Implemented a MEAN-stack based group chat application with emoji, notification, and file-upload support.
  \item Modeled distributed session handling and message passing between sockets on Redis to allow stateless servers.
  \item Planned the software design pre-development using Software Requirement Specification and Data Modeling.
\end{itemize}
