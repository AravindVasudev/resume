\section*{Academic Projects}
\noindent
\textbf{Yabber} \hfill \textit{Anna University} \\
%\texttt{\small \href{https://github.com/AravindVasudev/Yabber}{github.com/AravindVasudev/Yabber}} \\
A real-time web-based chat application built using \textcolor{blue}{MEAN stack}. Used MongoDB with \textcolor{blue}{Mongoose ODM} for persistence and schema definition. Used \textcolor{blue}{Redis} for caching and session storage.  \\
\\
\textbf{Defect Predictor} \hfill \textit{Anna University} \\
%\texttt{\small \href{https://github.com/AravindVasudev/defect-predictor}{github.com/AravindVasudev/defect-predictor}} \\
A \textcolor{blue}{machine learning tool} that predicts the number of bugs that might occur when that project is completed using various statistical data from the previous projects that the teams worked.\\
\\
\textbf{2048 AI} \hfill \textit{Anna University} \\
%\texttt{\small \href{https://github.com/AravindVasudev/2048}{github.com/AravindVasudev/2048}} \\
An \textcolor{blue}{AI solver} for the game 2048. Built using \textcolor{blue}{expectimax algorithm} with a depth limit of 5 and a heuristic function to compute the best move. \\
\\
\textbf{Gesture Glove} \hfill \textit{Anna University} \\
The glove \textcolor{blue}{aids speech impaired} people with the ability \textcolor{blue}{to communicate through hand gestures}. This is achieved by capturing the hand gesture using bend sensors and accelerometers and mapping a spoken sound signal to it. The project received \$1100 funding from the Department of Science and Technology (Govt. of India) under the banner of Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Cell.\\
\\
\textbf{Lendr} \hfill \textit{Anna University} \\
A hybrid-mobile application that facilitates lending-borrowing of everyday commodities around the neighborhood. Implemented the backend of the application using \textcolor{blue}{python and flask}.
