\section*{Experience}
\noindent
\textbf{Zoho Corporation} \hfill \textit{Chennai, India} \\
{\small Member Technical Staff} \hfill \textit{\small June 2018 - May 2019}  \\
Implemented frameworks and libraries that break down inter-dependencies between features and aided in migrating to a \textit{microservice-based architecture}. Introduced various design strategies such as aspect-oriented programming, reactive programming, and observable based runtime method calling interface.\\
\\
\textbf{Zoho Corporation} \hfill \textit{Chennai, India} \\
{\small Project Trainee} \hfill \textit{\small December 2017 - March 2018}  \\
Decoupled various features of a monolithic application into libraries and services. Built tools that automated repetitive jobs in the process. Redesigned various components in the enterprise level application.\\
\\
\textbf{Tata Consultancy Services} \hfill \textit{Chennai, India} \\
{\small Project Intern} \hfill \textit{\small June 2017 - July 2017}  \\
Built a chatbot that saves userâ€™s time from navigating through a long set of menus and options to access work-related data. Developed microservices using docker and interfaced it with the main application using REST API.

\section*{Academic Projects}
\noindent
\textbf{Yabber} \hfill \textit{Anna University} \\
\texttt{\small \href{https://github.com/AravindVasudev/Yabber}{github.com/AravindVasudev/Yabber}} \\
Designed and implemented a real-time web-based chat application built using MEAN stack. Used MongoDB with Mongoose ODM for persistence and schema definition. Used Redis for caching and session storing.  \\
\\
\textbf{2048 AI} \hfill \textit{Anna University} \\
\texttt{\small \href{https://github.com/AravindVasudev/2048}{github.com/AravindVasudev/2048}} \\
An AI solver for the game 2048 along with an implmentation. Built using expectimax algorithm with a depth limit of 5 and a heuristic function to compute the best move. \\
\\
\textbf{Gesture Glove} \hfill \textit{Anna University} \\
The glove aids speech impaired people with the ability to communicate through hand gestures. This is achieved by capturing the hand gesture using bend sensors and accelerometers and mapping a spoken sound signal to it.\\
\\
\textbf{Defect Predictor} \hfill \textit{Anna University} \\
\texttt{\small \href{https://github.com/AravindVasudev/defect-predictor}{github.com/AravindVasudev/defect-predictor}} \\
A machine learning tool that predicts the number of bugs that might occur when that project is completed using various statistical data from the previous projects that the teams worked. 

\section*{Awards and Honors}
\noindent
\textbf{Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Center} \\
Built a Gesture Glove for the speech-impaired capable of translating gestures into speech. The Project was sanctioned funds by the Department of Science and Technology (India) under the banner of IEDC (Innovation, Entreprenuership Development Cell) for means of entreprenuerial expansion. \\
