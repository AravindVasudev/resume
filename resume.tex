\\
\textbf{Meta Platforms, Inc.} \hfill \textit{Sunnyvale, CA} \\
{\small Software Engineer} \hfill \textit{\small April 2024 - Present}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Decreased ad retrieval service memory usage by 1.57GB by optimizing ad data fields, enabling efficient prediction models.
  \item Implemented efficient memory shedding strategy reducing OOMs under load by $\sim$90\% improving availability in Q4 2024.
  \item Designed a C++ compile-time flag to switch service data model based on build type which resulted in 1GB of memory savings.
  \item Enhanced the ad retrival querying flow to support a new request type, enabling new predictive modelling experiments.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Google LLC} \hfill \textit{Mountain View, CA} \\
{\small Software Engineer III} \hfill \textit{\small November 2021 - April 2024}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mitigated resource exhaustion-related outages in LUCI CV for chromium/chromiumos related projects by architecting a redis-based quota manager that limits the number of concurrent presubmit runs per user.
  \item Updated LUCI CV authorization to support ACLs from linked google-chromium email accounts simplifying ACL management.
  \item Optimized gclient sync no-op runtime by 51.4\% in windows that improved chromium developer experience.
  \item Redesigned depot\_tools to parse git submodules that unblocks chromium to move away from outdated DEPS.
  \item Reduced user frustration with git-repo by devising a condensed error summary UX that provided actionable next steps.
  \item Aided in master\textrightarrow main migration within the chromium project by contributing branch redirection feature to codesearch.
  \item Increased observability of xrefs coverage within chromium codesearch by building a metrics aggregation pipeline.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{GoDaddy Inc.} \hfill \textit{Kirkland, WA} \\
{\small Software Development Engineer II} \hfill \textit{\small March 2021 - November 2021}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Conceptualized a global control group feature which allows teams to access statistical impacts across a series of A/B tests.
  \item Integrated all our analytics services with monitoring tools to measure quality, availability, and performance of the product.
  \item Assembled a jenkins pipeline to test and auto-deploy projects using AWS CDK which is used by two new products.
  \item Volunteered for the scrum master role to handle our project backlog on Jira, scrum meetings, and retrospective.
\end{itemize}
{\small Intern --- Software Development Engineer} \hfill \textit{\small May 2020 - August 2020}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Reduced execution time of the analytics tool by two hours by redesigning it into multiple processes.
  \item Devised an AWS Batch based architecture to parallelize analysis in the analytics tool, which will further decrease runtime.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Zoho Corporation} \hfill \textit{Chennai, India} \\
{\small Member Technical Staff} \hfill \textit{\small June 2018 - May 2019}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Simplified transaction handling by implementing an annotation-based framework using Aspect-Oriented Programming.
  \item Built an HTTP connection pool library that can share pools between modules separated across multiple codebases.
  \item Modularized i18n keysets by developing a library to load and validate keys across multiple repositories without collision.
  \item Distributed configuration across runtime-dependent repositories by building a tool to manage and validate conf files.
\end{itemize}
{\small Project Trainee} \hfill \textit{\small December 2017 - March 2018}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Minimized dependency among teams by decoupling Zoho CRM into several compile-time independent components.
  \item Architected an observable-based inter-service communication framework that can resolve function calls at runtime.
\end{itemize}
